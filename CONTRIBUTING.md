## Commit message
  * Each commit message should start with prefix which contains hash and issue number, for example "#132"
  * Commits which doesn't affect project build status like updating docs files "README.md" (except "README.md" file for configuration module) doesn't have to build by Github action. To do that commit message should contain sufix "[skip ci]" 

## Branch naming convention
Try to name your branch based on type of issue related to it, for example:
    
  * Feature - Prefix "feature/", issue number and some short description, for example:
    
    Branch name for feature related to integration with Travis CI and with number 113.
    "feature/113_travis_integration"
  * Bugfix - Prefix "bugfix/", issue number and some short description, for example:
  
    Branch name for bugfix related to NullPointer exception and with number 227.
    "bugfix/227_nullpointer_exception"
